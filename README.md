# Corner-Grocery-Project
* This program is a C++ program that reads data from a file, and prints a list of the products and their frequencies. The user can choose to check the     frequency of a specific product, print a list of all products and their frequencies or print a list of all products and their frequency using a histogram. In this case '$' is used.Program will ask user for an option to print the lists until user decides to exit the program

* I think that I had a clear idea on how the program should work and then I checked the code as I was writting it to make sure it was functional.

* I think that the switch loop makes the code more efficent as it removes all the if else statements needed.

* During this project I found it hard to get the program to count the frequence of each item on the list. I had to do some research online and also watch some videos in YouTube that helped me to understand which was the best way to get those frequencies.

* This project helped me with the usage of classes and also functions. It also showed me how adding different libraries makes coding easier and more efficient. 

* I think that by using classes in my code the program is safer as it has private methods. I also followed best practices while writting the code, with inline comments to make it easier for others to understand or update in the future.
